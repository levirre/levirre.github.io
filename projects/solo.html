      <h3 class="project_headers"> The Problem:</h3>
      <p>Although many tools exist for looking up nearby locations for people to spend their day, few of them take into account the userâ€™s personal social preferences. More specifically, introversion or simply the desire to be left alone in a public space are rarely considered. Those who wish to get out of the house yet also desire some quiet time to themselves are left at a loss.

      </p>
      <h3 class="project_headers"> The Solution:</h3>
      <p> soloSD encourages people to go exploring by themselves and find comfort in doing so. Users can explore areas linked with the nearest safe facilities such as police stations and clinics.

    <h3 class="project_headers"> Discovery</h3>
      <p>Our current idea, soloSD, was established after being unable to find a unique niche when tackling the problem of: 
      <p><i>What trends can we find for mental health in relation to factors such as age, sex, race, and income to attach digestible visualizations that are manipulatable by layers of demographics available to us through the delphi dataset, and develop user stories enabling research to be more than just an overview of who is afflicted with what. </i></p>

      <p>of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
