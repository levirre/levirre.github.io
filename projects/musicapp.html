      <h3 class="project_headers"> The Problem:</h3>
      <p>Managing playlists through Mobile UI becomes a hassle when music libraries scale to hundreds of tracks. Due to constraining screen sizes, wanting to aggregate tracks across many albums into one playlist requires users to shift back and forth multiple times.

      </p>
      <h3 class="project_headers"> The Solution:</h3>
      <p>Our music wireframe aims to enable users to manipulate multiple songs at a time when they manage a playlist. We solve this problem by allowing for simultaneous selection alongside with more efficient routes between playlists and libraries.

    <h3 class="project_headers"> Discovery</h3>

    <p>
      We targeted users who actively listen to music with their phones checking when and where they do. This allowed us to quickly filter down ideas and validate or disprove our initial assumptions.How they manage playlists and the functions they use to switch tracks became our key key focus for design.
    </p>
    <p>
      We condense our interviews into 20 user scenarios to provide foundation for our competitive analysis. From here, we focus on five and explore each major music app in navigating through each user scenario. We measure efficacy by how many layers it takes to complete a scenario starting from the homepage.
    </p>

    <!--
      <p>First, we conducted interviews surveying which apps they used, and the contexts they use their phone for music.
      </p>
      <p>Basic Interview Template:</p>
      <h5>Warm-up</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you often listen to music on your cell?</li>
        <li>Do you have a music app on your phone? Do you use it? Which one?</li>
        <li>Do you buy music tracks or albums?</li>
      </ul>
       <h5>Playlists-listening</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you like to choose individual tracks or albums and listen that way? OR do you prefer playlists?</li>
        <li>What do you do with the tracks once you buy them? Do you put them in a playlist right away? Do you let things accumulate and then make playlists? What is your style?</li>
        <li>When did you last use a playlist? What were you doing?
Can you think of other times when you recently listened to a playlist? What were you doing?</li>
      </ul>-->

    <h3 class="project_headers">Design Solutions</h3>
      <p>
        We propose the use of volume keys for quick use as they are tactile enough to operate without directing any attention to find them. From here, we design a low power mode that can read gestures and swipe directions to operate moving between playlists or going through a large playlist roulette style.
      </p>

      <p>
        We focus on the idea of shuffling through playlists and tracks without needing to look at the screen. When our interviewees described doing tasks like running, working out, or driving, it is often cumbersome to swipe across the screen accurately to change to a track suited for the moment.

      <p>We combine common gestures along with brightness control to deliver a low power music app for use when your focus is ahead of you while running or driving. </p>
